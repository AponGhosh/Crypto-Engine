# Crypto Engine


## Overview
The **Crypto Engine** is a project developed for the **Structured Programming Lab (CSE104)** at the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB). It translates plaintext into ciphertext (encryption) and vice versa (decryption) using two cryptographic algorithms: **Mono-alphabetic** and **Caesar** ciphers. This project aims to provide hands-on experience with cryptography basics and collaborative C programming.

## Features
- Supports two cryptographic algorithms:
  - **Mono-alphabetic Cipher**  
  - **Caesar Cipher**  
- Allows users to:
  - Encrypt plaintext into ciphertext.  
  - Decrypt ciphertext back to plaintext.  
  - Input custom private keys for encryption/decryption.  
- User-friendly menu-driven interface.

## Algorithms
1. **Caesar Cipher**:  
   - A substitution cipher that shifts letters by a fixed number (key) in the alphabet.  
2. **Mono-alphabetic Cipher**:  
   - A substitution cipher where each letter is mapped to another predefined letter.  

## Tools
- **Programming Language**: C  
- **Primary IDE**: Visual Studio Code  
- **Compiler**: GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)  
- **Collaboration Tool**: repl.it (for real-time group coding)  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-engine.git
